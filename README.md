# AI-Chatbot-with-NLP
# ðŸ¤– ChatPy â€” Simple NLP Chatbot

This project is a **rule-based + retrieval-based chatbot** built using Python and NLP libraries.  
It uses **spaCy** or **NLTK** (if available) for natural language processing, and falls back to a simple tokenizer if not.  

The chatbot can answer **common queries**, do **small chit-chat**, and retrieve the best matching answer from a **knowledge base** using a **TF-IDF + cosine similarity** approach.
